/// The WKT (like) format for geometries (implements [GeometryFormat]).
///
/// Rules applied by the format are aligned with WKT (Well-known text
/// representation of geometry) formatting of coordinate lists.
///
/// Examples:
/// * point (x, y): `10.1 20.2`
/// * point (x, y, z): `10.1 20.2 30.3`
/// * point (x, y, z, m): `10.1 20.2 30.3 40.4`
/// * box (min-x, min-y, max-x, max-y): `10.1 10.1,20.2 20.2`
/// * box (min-x, min-y, min-z, max-x, max-y, maz-z):
///   * `10.1 10.1 10.1,20.2 20.2 20.2`
/// * line string, multi point (with 2D points):
///   * `10.1 10.1,20.2 20.2,30.3 30.3`
/// * polygon, multi line string (with 2D points):
///   * `(35 10,45 45,15 40,10 20,35 10)`
/// * multi polygon (with 2D points):
///   * `((35 10,45 45,15 40,10 20,35 10))`
/// * coordinates for other geometries with similar principles
///
/// Note that WKT does not specify bounding box formatting. In some applications
/// bounding boxes are formatted as polygons. An example presented above however
/// format bounding box as a point series of two points (min, max). See also
/// `wktFormat` that formats them as polygons.
