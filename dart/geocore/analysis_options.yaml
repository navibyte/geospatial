# Some rules that were enabled by "very_good_analysis" disabled here
linter:
  rules:
    # "DO avoid relative imports for files in lib/."
    # What's wrong with relative imports between source code inside lib.
    # So disable this rule. However "avoid_relative_lib_imports" is enabled.
    always_use_package_imports: false

    # "AVOID returning null from members whose return type is bool, double, int,
    #  or num."
    # As dart-lint is commenting, this rule has lost it's meaning after proper
    # null-safety support on Dart. And there are valid cases for returning nulls
    # even for primitive types.
    avoid_returning_null: false

    # "DO use int literals rather than the corresponding double literal."
    # It's better to use 0.0 or 342.0 for doubles than 0 and 342.
    # For example in code setting geospatial coordinates, like latitude and
    # longitude, it feels more natural using double literals always.
    prefer_int_literals: false

    # "DO sort constructor declarations before other members."
    # This rule is very opionated. Sometimes for domain data classes with lot
    # of contructors and named factories, it would be nices to put field members
    # first, then constructors. However for most of other cases the rule might
    # be good.
    # See also discussion on lint: https://github.com/passsy/dart-lint/issues/1
    sort_constructors_first: false

    # "DO sort pub dependencies in pubspec.yaml."
    # Yes do sort most of time, but sometimes better to organize logically.
    # For example first sorted list of packages from external vendors, then
    # next sorted list of custom packages.
    sort_pub_dependencies: false
