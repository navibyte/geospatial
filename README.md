## :building_construction: Roadmap

üß© See [open issues](https://github.com/navibyte/geospatial/issues) for planned features, requests for change, and observed bugs.

üí° Any comments, questions, suggestions of new features and other other
contributions are welcome, of course!

ü™Ñ New features shall be **actively added and development continues** on 
[geobase](https://pub.dev/packages/geobase) and 
[geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) packages. 

‚ö†Ô∏è However after the `geocore` version 0.10.0 (published at 2022-08-21), no new
features are currently planned on the
[geocore](https://pub.dev/packages/geocore) package. Still this package too
shall be maintained as a part of this repository.
