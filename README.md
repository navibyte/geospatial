**Geospatial** data structures, tools and utilities for 
[Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) mobile developers.

Please see also generic (non-geospatial) data structures, tools and utilities at
the separate [Dataflow tools for Dart](https://github.com/navibyte/dataflow)
repository.

Packages and documentation are published at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/). 

Latest package releases:

Package @ pub.dev | Version | Documentation | Example code 
----------------- | --------| ------------- | -----------
:globe_with_meridians: [geocore](https://pub.dev/packages/geocore) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geocore.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geocore) | [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/geocore/latest/) | [Example](https://pub.dev/packages/geocore/example)
:earth_americas: [geodata](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/geodata.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata) | [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/geodata/latest/) | [Example](https://pub.dev/packages/geodata/example)

Previously part of this repository, but starting from the version 0.6.0 code for
these is hosted at the [dataflow](https://github.com/navibyte/dataflow)
repository:

Package @ pub.dev | Version | Documentation | Example code 
----------------- | --------| ------------- | -----------
:spiral_notepad: [attributes](https://pub.dev/packages/attributes) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/attributes.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/attributes) | [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/attributes/latest/) | [Example](https://pub.dev/packages/attributes/example)
:cloud: [datatools](https://pub.dev/packages/datatools) | [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/datatools.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/datatools) | [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/datatools/latest/) | [Example](https://pub.dev/packages/datatools/example)

All packages supports Dart [null-safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) and 
using them requires at least
[Dart 2.12](https://medium.com/dartlang/announcing-dart-2-12-499a6e689c87)
from the stable channel. Please see the official 
[null-safety migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide).

## :page_facing_up: Code
